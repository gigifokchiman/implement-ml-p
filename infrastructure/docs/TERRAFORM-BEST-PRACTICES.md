# Terraform Best Practices Summary

*Based on HashiCorp's Terraform Cloud Recommended Practices*

## üéØ Core Philosophy

Terraform should be the foundation for **collaborative infrastructure as code**, managing infrastructure boundaries
between teams, roles, applications, and deployment tiers.

## üìà Four Stages of Infrastructure Maturity

### 1. Manual Changes

- Ad-hoc infrastructure modifications
- No version control or automation
- High risk of configuration drift

### 2. Semi-Automation

- Basic scripting and tools
- Some automated provisioning
- Limited collaboration capabilities

### 3. Infrastructure as Code

- Version-controlled infrastructure definitions
- Automated provisioning and updates
- Consistent environments

### 4. Collaborative Infrastructure as Code ‚úÖ *Our Target*

- Team-based workflows with proper governance
- Systematic change management
- Cross-functional collaboration

## üèóÔ∏è Key Implementation Practices

### Workspace Organization

- **Principle**: Organize workspaces by environment and application boundaries
- **Implementation**: Separate workspaces for `local`, `dev`, `staging`, `prod`
- **Governance**: Define clear ownership and access controls per workspace

### State Management

- **Principle**: Centralized, secure state storage with proper locking
- **Implementation**: Use remote backends (Terraform Cloud, S3 + DynamoDB)
- **Security**: Encrypt state files and limit access

### Configuration Practices

- **Modularity**: Create reusable modules for common patterns
- **Standardization**: Use consistent naming conventions and tagging
- **Environment Parity**: Maintain similar configurations across environments
- **Version Control**: All Terraform code must be version controlled

### Security Practices

- **Secrets Management**: Never store secrets in Terraform code
- **Least Privilege**: Apply minimal required permissions
- **State Security**: Protect state files with encryption and access controls
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain logs of all infrastructure changes

### Collaboration Workflows

- **Pull Request Reviews**: All changes require peer review
- **Automated Testing**: Validate configurations before deployment
- **Change Planning**: Use `terraform plan` for change visibility
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear module and workspace documentation

### Testing Strategies

- **Validation**: Use `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt`
- **Policy as Code**: Implement governance with Sentinel or OPA
- **Integration Tests**: Test infrastructure after deployment
- **Rollback Plans**: Define procedures for reverting changes

### Deployment Patterns

- **Automated Pipelines**: Use CI/CD for consistent deployments
- **Environment Progression**: Deploy through dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí prod
- **Blue/Green Deployments**: Support zero-downtime deployments
- **Monitoring**: Track infrastructure changes and health

## üîÑ Our Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What We've Achieved

- **Modular Architecture**: Created reusable modules for database, cache, storage, monitoring, secrets
- **Environment Standardization**: Consistent configurations across local, dev, staging, prod
- **Security Implementation**: NetworkPolicies, Pod Security Standards, secret management
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana with ML-specific metrics
- **Version Control**: All code is tracked in Git with proper structure

### üéØ Next Steps for Full Compliance

- **Terraform Cloud Integration**: Migrate from local state to Terraform Cloud workspaces
- **Policy as Code**: Implement Sentinel policies for governance
- **Automated Testing**: Add terraform validate/plan to CI/CD pipeline
- **Change Management**: Establish PR review process for infrastructure changes
- **Documentation**: Expand module documentation and runbooks

## üìã Implementation Checklist

- [x] Create modular Terraform architecture
- [x] Implement environment-specific configurations
- [x] Add comprehensive security controls
- [x] Establish monitoring and observability
- [ ] Set up Terraform Cloud workspaces
- [ ] Implement policy as code governance
- [ ] Create automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Establish change management process
- [ ] Document operational procedures

## üöÄ Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: Infrastructure is now standardized across environments
2. **Security**: Comprehensive security controls with NetworkPolicies and secrets management
3. **Observability**: Full monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana
4. **Maintainability**: Modular design allows for easy updates and reuse
5. **Scalability**: Environment-aware modules support growth from dev to production

This foundation positions us well for advancing to full collaborative infrastructure as code practices with proper
governance and automation.
