# ARCHIVED: Kustomize vs ArgoCD Discussion

**Date**: 2025-07-02
**Context**: Discussion about whether Kustomize is needed with ArgoCD and why Kustomize can be difficult to handle.

## Key Points Discussed

### 1. ArgoCD vs Kustomize Relationship
- **Misconception**: "You don't need Kustomize if you use ArgoCD"
- **Reality**: ArgoCD has built-in Kustomize support and uses it automatically
- **Relationship**: Kustomize defines WHAT to deploy, ArgoCD automates HOW to deploy it

### 2. Why Kustomize Can Be Difficult
- **Mental Model Complexity**: Need to compile YAML across multiple files mentally
- **Multiple Patch Methods**: Strategic merge, JSON patches, replacements - confusing choices
- **Debugging Challenges**: Hard to trace where values come from
- **Version Compatibility**: Different Kustomize versions produce different outputs
- **Overlay Explosion**: Complex projects end up with many overlays

### 3. How ArgoCD Helps
- **Visual Diff**: See exactly what will change before applying
- **Centralized Build**: Consistent Kustomize version on ArgoCD server
- **Easy Rollback**: One-click rollback with full history
- **Preview Changes**: Dry-run in UI without kubectl
- **Clear Status**: Know what's deployed where

### 4. Decision Made
Based on the discussion, we decided to:
1. **Implement ArgoCD** for better GitOps workflow
2. **Keep Kustomize** as the configuration management layer
3. **Archive the manual deployment scripts** (but keep for reference)

## Original Pain Points Addressed by ArgoCD

| Pain Point | Manual Kustomize | With ArgoCD |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Final YAML visibility | Run `kustomize build` | Visual in UI |
| Deployment tracking | Check kubectl | ArgoCD dashboard |
| Rollback | Manual kubectl | One-click UI |
| Multi-env management | Multiple scripts | ArgoCD apps |
| Version consistency | Local variations | Server-side build |

## Migration Path
1. Install ArgoCD in each environment
2. Create ArgoCD Application manifests
3. Configure sync policies
4. Set up RBAC and projects
5. Document new workflow

This discussion led to the implementation of ArgoCD while maintaining our Kustomize structure for configuration management.
