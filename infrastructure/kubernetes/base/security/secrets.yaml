# Secrets are now generated by environment-specific secretGenerator configurations
# in overlay kustomization.yaml files to avoid conflicts.
#
# Each environment generates:
# - database-credentials: Connection details for PostgreSQL
# - redis-credentials: Connection details for Redis/ElastiCache
#
# This approach ensures environment-specific secrets without base conflicts.
