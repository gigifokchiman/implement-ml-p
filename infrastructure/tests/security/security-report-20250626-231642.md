# ML Platform Security Report

Generated: Thu Jun 26 23:16:42 PDT 2025

## Test Results

✅ Terraform security (Checkov)
✅ Terraform security (tfsec)
✅ Kubernetes security (kubesec)
✅ Kubernetes security (kube-score)
✅ Container security (Trivy)
✅ Secret detection (gitleaks)
✅ Secret detection (trufflehog)
✅ Network policy compliance
✅ Pod Security Standards
✅ Resource limits compliance
✅ Backup strategy compliance

## Security Recommendations

### High Priority

- [ ] Enable Pod Security Standards in all namespaces
- [ ] Implement network policies for micro-segmentation
- [ ] Set up centralized secret management (AWS Secrets Manager)
- [ ] Configure container image scanning in CI/CD

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Implement admission controllers (OPA Gatekeeper)
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- [ ] Implement infrastructure as code security scanning

### Low Priority

- [ ] Consider service mesh for mTLS (Istio/Linkerd)
- [ ] Implement zero-trust networking
- [ ] Set up security benchmarks (CIS Kubernetes Benchmark)

## Compliance Status

### SOC 2 Type II

- [x] Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- [x] Encryption at rest (RDS, EBS)
- [x] Access controls (RBAC)
- [ ] Audit logging (TODO: CloudTrail, audit logs)

### GDPR

- [x] Data minimization (explicit data models)
- [ ] Data retention policies (TODO)
- [ ] Right to erasure implementation (TODO)

### PCI DSS (if applicable)

- [x] Network segmentation
- [x] Encryption requirements
- [ ] Regular security testing (TODO)

## Next Steps

1. Address failed security tests
2. Implement missing security controls
3. Set up continuous security monitoring
4. Schedule regular security reviews
