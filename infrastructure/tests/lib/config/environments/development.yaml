# Development environment configuration
# Balanced approach - security-conscious but allows development flexibility

# Development security settings
security:
  severity_threshold: "HIGH"     # High and critical issues
  fail_on_violations: true       # Block on violations
  max_violations: 10             # Limited violations allowed

  # Development-specific skip checks (minimal set)
  skip_checks:
    checkov:
      # Cost optimization exemptions for development
      - "CKV_AWS_109" # S3 lifecycle policy
      - "CKV_AWS_61"  # S3 public access (for testing)

      # Development workflow exemptions
      - "CKV_K8S_43"  # Allow latest tags for rapid iteration

    trivy:
      # Allow some S3 access for development testing
      - "AVD-AWS-0089" # S3 bucket logging (trivy equivalent)

# Development tool settings
tools:
  checkov:
    soft_fail: false             # Enforce security standards
    download_external_modules: true

  terraform:
    parallelism: 4               # Moderate parallelism

# Development cache settings
cache:
  max_age_minutes: 90           # Moderate caching

# Development reporting
